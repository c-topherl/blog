	<h1>Building A Workout Routine Part 1: Choosing Your Split</h1>
</div>

<div class="col-xs-12">
	<p>Your "split" refers to how many days per week you lift weights, and what muscles you focus on each of those days.</p>

	<p>If you're a novice lifter, your primary goal is to build strength, and there are a plethora of programs available on the internet to help you do that. I recommend <a href="http://stronglifts.com/madcow/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm" target="_blank">the 5x5</a> or <a href="http://www.nobsbb.com/starting-strength-workout-routine-program-results/" target="_blank">starting strength</a>. Hundreds upon hundreds of people have had success with these programs. <strong>Don't mess with them-they work.</strong> You'll notice that all these beginner strength routines are basically full-body workouts each day that you lift. Novice lifters who are lifting small percentages of their maximum potential still can handle this-recovery isn't as intense so their muscles and central nervous systems bounce right back for the next workout. If you're a beginner, stop reading right now, go follow one of these programs and check back here in about a year.</p>

	<p>As you progress over time and lift more and more weight, each workout will be significantly more taxing on both your muscles and CNS as a whole-you simply can't squat, deadlift and bench press all in one workout anymore without performance taking a huge hit. So, you have to design a split. I don't recommend going beyond 4-5 days per week for bulking, or beyond 3 days per week for cutting. More volume than that is plain unnecessary unless you're a very advanced bodybuilder. When you're going to the gym a few days per week and lifting heavy ass weights (which you should be), your body needs time to recover. Barraging it with 6-7 days of intense weightlifting will stall you out fast. Leave that to the pros.</p> 

	<p>Cutting? Since you are in a calorie deficit, your body's ability to recover is impaired. For that reason, you shouldn't be doing more than three lifting sessions per week.</p> 

	<br>

	<p>So, now I've convinced you to tone down the volume. I prefer a 3 day split as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Day 1: Back/biceps (pull)</li>
		<li>Day 2: Rest</li>
		<li>Day 3: Chest/triceps (push)</li>
		<li>Day 4: Rest</li>
		<li>Day 5: Legs/shoulders</li>
		<li>Day 6: Rest</li>
		<li>Day 7: Rest</li>
	</ul>

	<br>

	<p>Some people prefer doing all arm exercises on one day, some people prefer splitting this out to four days, etc-fine, go for it. I cannot stress enough, though, that <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2009/01/minimalist.html" target="_blank">the minimalist approach is best</a>, even when bulking. Just make sure you're not setting yourself up to have to perform a lot of heavy compound lifts in one day so you can give each lift 100%.</p>
