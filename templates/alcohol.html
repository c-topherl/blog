	<p>Let's face it-we all know alcohol isn't going to help us get ripped and shredded. But what's the point of working hard and having a great physique if you can't enjoy it or show it off at all? We should be finding a way to build training and dieting into our lifestyles, which requires some flexibility.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Alcohol is a poison to our body. No matter what we've consumed up to the point of drinking alcohol, our body will "stop what it's doing" (stop digesting any regular food or drink products) and focus its attention on getting rid of the "poison" (alcohol). The problem with this, then, is that if we've eaten a bunch of carbs and fat, we have significantly increased the chances of these being stored as fat in our bodies instead of burned off as normal. Enter the first strategy to incorporating alcohol into our diets...</p>

	<br>

	<p>Reduce your calorie goal for the day by about 500 calories, taking all of these calories from carbohydrates and fat. This will allow your body to focus on getting rid of the alcohol in your system without real risk of putting on fat. It won't be fun, but the crazy amounts of binge drinking you get to do afterwards will be. If you're following this protocol, eat lots of lean protein and veggies. I borrowed this strategy from Martin Berkhan. You can read more about it, and the effects of alcohol on training, <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<br>

	<p>If the first strategy sounds too unenjoyable for you, the next strategy is to learn to <em>truly drink in moderation</em>. Let your friends stick to the keg stands, power hours and shots. There's something to be said about someone who can go out to a bar with friends and doesn't need to get wasted to enjoy themselves or their company. This method will really test your social skills as you can't lean on the social lubricant very much. Assuming you're not doing this every day, having 3-4 drinks in a night out won't put on fat for you, it just might stall your progress a bit. Not the end of the world. Plus, you'll wake up feeling refreshed (unlike your hungover friends) and <a href="http://www.lowcarbfriends.com/bbs/showthread.php?t=758588" target="_blank">maybe even lighter</a>! <a href="http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/10/cocktail-science-do-alcohol-calories-count-digesting-spirits.html" target="_blank">There is a lot of debate around whether alcohol calories actually count to begin with</a>. Plus, when you're out partying at a bar, you're going to burn more calories than usual just from standing, walking from bar to bar and dancing. In the grand scheme of things, that extra ~250 calories from 3-4 mixed drinks is no sweat.</p>

	<br>

	<p>A third option is a combination of the first two options! Removing 500 calories for the day is uncomfortable and not fun, especially when I'm on a cut and my goal for the day is already a low 1900 calories to begin with. Then again, limiting myself to 3-4 drinks over the span of an all day drinking event I'm participating in with my friends isn't easy, either. I like to find a healthy balance between the two: reduce calorie intake by 200-300 calories for the day, and limit myself to 6 or 7 drinks for the night/event. This seems to be the sweet spot for me and I have not noticed any sort of significant fat or weight gain from it. Additionally, I always push my fat and carbohydrate calories as far away from the time of drinking as possible. If I'm going out at night, I'll put all the carbs and fats I plan to eat for the day in my first two meals. My third and final meal before going out will consist entirely of lean meats and vegetables so there's less chance of anything interfering with my body's processing of the alcohol.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Finally, you can always simply work the drink calories into your calorie count, but where's the fun in that?</p>

	<br>
	
	<p>The last thing that needs to be considered is drink choice. Spirits (whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, gin) and dry red wines are the best choices as they're lower in calories (as far as alcohol goes) and contain almost no carbs. The best mixers are club soda/tonic water, followed by diet soda products. Don't be too obsessive over what you're drinking-drinks are meant to be enjoyed, after all! Just be conscious of what you're drinking and you'll be fine.</p>
