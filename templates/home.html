	<p>I've always been the kind of person who wants to be among the elite, no matter the category. When it comes to fitness, this means not only strength and muscle development, but a low level of leanness as well, leading to a <strong>desirable and admirable physique</strong>.</p>

  	<br>

  	<p>I'm human-I have a day job, a girlfriend and hobbies. I've been through the crash diets and fitness programs requiring 6-7 days per week in the gym. Not only did they fail to produce sustainable results, <em>they made for an unfulfilling lifestyle</em>.</p>

  	<br>

  	<p>I wanted a way to <strong>make fitness fit into my lifestyle</strong>-not make my lifestyle revolve around fitness. I wanted the results without having to pass up on the sporting events, work happy hours and birthday dinners! None of these events are possible if you're spending hours in the gym or limiting yourself to boiled chicken and broccoli day in and day out.</p>

  	<br>

  	<p>I've spent countless hours both pouring over fitness articles and putting them to the test in the gym and kitchen. While I found a lot of methods that <em>don't</em> work, I've also managed to take the bits that do and piece them together into the robust programs you'll find throughout this site.</p>

  	<br>

  	<p>These guides aren't for the casual consumer who wants to "lose a few pounds"-they're for those who want to adopt training seamlessly into their lifestyle, achieve elite levels of fitness and <strong>really train to reign</strong>.</p> 
  
  	<br>

  	<p>Hope you enjoy, and I can't wait to hear the success stories.</p> 

  	<br>
